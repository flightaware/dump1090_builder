dump1090 (1.2-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Compile in the FlightAware package version as the dump1090 version.

  * Change the default port for Beast input to port 30104. This port is
    the new default used by piaware to connect to a mlat-aware dump1090
    (we are mlat-aware) to forward mlat results. To return to using port
    30004, use the --net-bi-port option.

dump1090 (1.2-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Disable forwarding of mlat results to output ports by default. This
    can be re-enabled with --forward-mlat.

dump1090 (1.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Identify incoming multilateration results from fa-mlat-client and
    color those aircraft differently in the side table.

  * Disable the FATSV port by default. piaware 2.1 uses its own copy
    of faup1090 to do FATSV translation.

  * Static link librtlsdr and don't ship a separate copy. This makes this
    dump1090 package play more nicely with other packages that want to
    provide librtlsdr.

dump1090 (1.1-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * auto-gain is now enabled for the RTL-SDR dongle, considerably extending
    its range and message rate.  (Change made to the fadump1090.sh script)

  * Install view1090 as part of the dump1090 package install.  (View1090 is
    nice for seeing what's going on when you're logged into your Raspberry Pi
    or whatever you're running dump1090 on.)

  * Add control to make Google Map full-screen.  (Clicking on the "handle"
    barrier between the map and sidebar now shows and hides the sidebar.)

  * Initialize tsvVerbatim to avoid the risk of writing garbage to FATSV
    connections.  (Hat tip to github user "mutability" for the pull request.)

  * within-dump1090 message buffering rate limits removed from the
    fadump1090.sh script.  Those switches are more for Windows, anyway, and
    could introduce unneeded latency.  (The FlightAware TSV upload tech
    is already filtered and buffered.)
