First: the first few commits to this repo will involve path names that are not quite up-to-date or functional outside of my dev flightfeeder.
	Any references to my home directory are temporary, and will be removed in a later/final draft.

To create a new .deb package:
	cd to top-level directory (like /home/your_name/src/fa-adept-adsb or something)
	There should be, at minimum, a Makefile and a ship-list.
	- make pkg
	- cd fa-adept-adsb-1.0
	- `../files/xfer`

	xfer copies over some files necessary for the debian package to build, and then runs `dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot`

	The top-level Makefile packs, unpacks, and repacks the source code into a correctly-formatted tarball with a name that dh_make recognizes.
		It also creates the package directory with the expected name and format (fa-adept-adsb-1.0/)




/usr/local/lib/librtlsdr.so.0.5git may cause some issues yet, but for now, all I know is that it should probably be in place when you try to build the deb package.
